## Name tag

A name tag is a badge or sticker worn on the outermost clothing as a means of displaying the wearer's name for others to
view.

Name tags may be temporary, such as a sticker with the iconic image being the "Hello! My Name Is ________"; or it may be
a more durable type. Temporary ones typically can be written upon so that the wearer's name may be handwritten or
printed. Permanent name tags are usually made of lightweight metal or plastic and may be known as name badges.

Name tags may be attached to garments with adhesive or worn with the assistance of a magnet or pin. Plastic or metal
name tags can be attached to various backings used to attach to the clothing of the wearer. There are many types of name
tag backings, including magnetic backings, locking pins, swivel clips, military clutch pins, alligator clips, and cell
phone attachments. Magnetic backings, because they do not puncture clothing with pins, have recently become more popular
for name tags. Some name tags are worn around the neck using a lanyard or necklace.

Name tags with magnetic backings pose a harmful threat to people who have pacemakers, as the magnet will interfere with
the implant's normal function. It is suggested that people who have pacemakers use pinback backings with their name tags
to avoid any disturbance with the pacemaker.

Name tags are used by some customer service companies, such as fast food restaurants, so that customers may identify
employees by name. Professional employees or representatives of public-facing organizations such as universities, banks,
or other companies where employees do not wear uniforms, may wear name tags as a way of distinguishing or identifying
the bearer as such, while allowing the employee to wear daily business wear.
